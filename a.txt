COMPILER



Well I forgot to commit one part. 
Now I seperated heap, global, and stack
Now I have a pipeline which is active for only normal and doesn't actually
implement commands. Now those commands should be an actual thing.

Also I have to figure out fonts. Because now there should write something so
it can actually look cool and worthful :D
